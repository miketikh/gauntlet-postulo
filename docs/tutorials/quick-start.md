   Our client John Doe was stopped at a red light when he was rear-ended by Jane Smith.

## Tips for Success

### Document Upload

**Best Practices**:
- Upload comprehensive evidence
- Name files descriptively
- Use clear, readable scans
- Include all relevant documents

**Quality Matters**:
- Better source docs = better AI output
- Blurry scans reduce extraction quality
- Include context (police reports, correspondence)

### AI Generation

**Optimization**:
- Provide complete case details
- Select most specific template
- Upload docs before generating
- Review output carefully

**Remember**:
- AI is assistant, not replacement
- Always verify facts
- Check dates and amounts
- Ensure legal accuracy

### Refinement Strategy

**Efficient Workflow**:
1. Generate complete draft first
2. Read through entirely
3. Identify sections to improve
4. Refine strategically (not every paragraph)
5. Make final manual tweaks

**Don't Over-Refine**:
- Quality > quantity of refinements
- 2-3 refinements usually sufficient
- Too many can make tone inconsistent

### Version Control

**Strategic Snapshots**:
- After AI generation
- After major edits
- Before sharing
- Before finalizing

**Descriptive Names**:
- "After paralegal draft"
- "Attorney review incorporated"
- "Pre-settlement version"
- NOT "version 2" or "update"

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Takes Too Long

- Normal: 30-60 seconds
- If >2 minutes, check internet connection
- Try refreshing page
- Check API status (support)

### Refinement Not Working

- Ensure text is selected (minimum 20 characters)
- Try selecting complete sentences
- Check internet connection
- Verify you're in edit mode

### Export Fails

- Try exporting without letterhead
- Verify project has content
- Clear browser cache

### Can't Upload Documents

- Check file size (<50MB)
- Verify file type (PDF, DOCX, images)
