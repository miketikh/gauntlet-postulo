## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Epic 5 Tracks Are Fully Independent**
   - Track A (Refinement: 5.1-5.6) and Track B (Export: 5.7-5.11) have zero conflicts
   - Can run in parallel with 2 engineers

2. **Most of Epic 6 Can Start Immediately**
   - Stories 6.1-6.12 polish existing Epic 1-4 features
   - Can run in parallel with Epic 5

3. **Critical Dependency: Story 6.13 Blocked by Epic 5**
   - 6.13 (Admin Panel) requires 5.9 (Letterhead) + 5.10 (Export Analytics)
   - This is NOT documented in workflow_execution.md (needs correction)

4. **Timeline**
   - Weeks 1-4: Parallel Epic 5 + Epic 6 (6.1-6.12)
   - Week 4: 5.9 & 5.10 complete → unblocks 6.13
   - Weeks 5-6: Complete Epic 5 Track A + 6.13 (Admin Panel)

### Track Independence Verification

| Aspect | Track A | Track B | Conflicts? |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Files** | refinement-panel.tsx, refine/route.ts | export-modal.tsx, export/route.ts | ❌ None |
| **API Routes** | /api/ai/refine/* | /api/drafts/:id/export/* | ❌ None |
| **Database** | ai_refinements table | draft_exports table, firms schema | ❌ None |
| **Services** | refinement.service.ts | export.service.ts | ❌ None |

**Verdict:** ✅ Tracks A and B are FULLY INDEPENDENT - can run in parallel

---

## Epic 6: Production Readiness & Polish

### Stories 6.1-6.12: Independent Polish (Can Start Immediately)

These stories refine existing Epic 1-4 features and can run while Epic 5 progresses:

**Testing & Quality (6.1, 6.2, 6.5, 6.6):**
- 6.1 - Unit + Integration Test Coverage (80%+ backend, 70%+ frontend)
- 6.2 - E2E Tests with Playwright/Cypress
- 6.5 - Security Audit (OWASP Top 10, penetration testing)
- 6.6 - WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Compliance

**Performance (6.3, 6.4):**
- 6.3 - Database Query Optimization (indexes, N+1 resolution)
- 6.4 - Frontend Bundle Optimization (code splitting, <300KB)

**Monitoring & Compliance (6.7, 6.8):**
- 6.7 - Production Monitoring (CloudWatch, Sentry, alerts)
- 6.8 - Audit Logging for Compliance (immutable logs, 7-year retention)

**UX Polish (6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12):**
- 6.9 - User-Friendly Error Handling
- 6.10 - Loading States & Progress Indicators
- 6.11 - Responsive Design Refinements
- 6.12 - User Documentation & Onboarding

**Dependencies:** All require Epic 1-4 complete ✅

**Duration:** 4 weeks (2 engineers working in parallel)

---

### Story 6.13: Admin Panel (BLOCKED by Epic 5)

**Prerequisites:**
- 1.9 (RBAC) ✅ Complete
- 6.8 (Audit Logging) - in same epic
- **5.9 (Letterhead Configuration)** ⚠️ Epic 5 Track B
- **5.10 (Export Analytics)** ⚠️ Epic 5 Track B

**Features:**
1. User Management (list, add, edit, deactivate)
2. Firm Settings (name, address, contact, **letterhead config**, default template, billing)
3. Usage Analytics (letters generated, AI tokens, **export counts**, user adoption)
4. Audit Log Viewer
5. System Health Dashboard

**Blocking Dependencies:**
- **Letterhead Configuration** (5.9) - Admin panel provides UI to configure letterhead used in exports
- **Export Counts** (5.10) - Admin panel shows export analytics from `draft_exports` table

**Workaround:** Can build 80% of admin panel (user management, basic settings, AI analytics) while waiting for 5.9/5.10. Add letterhead and export analytics sections after Epic 5 Track B completes.

**Duration:** 1.5-2 weeks (can start Week 4 when 5.9/5.10 complete)

---

### Story 6.14: Production Deployment (MUST BE LAST)

**Prerequisites:** ALL of 6.1-6.13 complete

**Tasks:**
- Production environment provisioning (AWS Lightsail)
- Blue-green deployment setup
- Smoke tests and monitoring verification
- Rollback plan testing

**Duration:** 1 week (all engineers coordinate)

---

## Conflict Analysis & Coordination

### Database Conflicts

**Potential Issues:**
1. **5.9 + 6.3**: Story 5.9 adds letterhead fields to `firms` table; Story 6.3 adds indexes to same table
2. **6.3 + 6.8**: Both create migrations (6.3 for indexes, 6.8 for audit_logs)

**Resolution:**
- Coordinate migration timing: 5.9 schema changes first → 6.3 optimization second
- Merge 6.3 and 6.8 database work into single migration if possible
- Assign to same engineer or daily sync

### Middleware Conflicts

**Potential Issues:**
1. **6.8 + 6.9**: Story 6.8 adds audit logging middleware; Story 6.9 refactors error handling middleware

**Resolution:**
- Assign both to same engineer (Engineer 3 in plan below)
- Implement 6.8 first, then refactor errors in 6.9
- Both touch `lib/middleware/` files

### Frontend Component Conflicts

**Potential Issues:**
1. **6.10 + 6.11**: Both modify existing components (loading states vs responsive styling)

**Resolution:**
- Assign to same engineer (Engineer 4)
- 6.10 adds loading UI, 6.11 adjusts breakpoints/layout
- Coordinate changes to avoid Tailwind conflicts

### API Endpoint Conflicts

**None identified** - Epic 5 and Epic 6 create different routes

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: 5.9 Schema Changes Block 6.3 Optimization

**Impact:** High - Database schema conflicts

**Mitigation:**
- Complete 5.9 in Week 3 (Engineer 2)
- Engineer 3 starts 6.3 optimization in Week 1-2 (before 5.9)
- Coordinate migrations: 6.3 indexes after 5.9 schema changes
- Daily sync between Engineers 2 & 3

### Risk 2: 6.13 Starts Before 5.9/5.10 Complete

**Impact:** Medium - Rework required for letterhead and analytics

**Mitigation:**
- Hard block 6.13 start until Week 5 (after 5.9+5.10 confirmed Week 4)
- Build 6.13 MVP without letterhead/analytics first, add later if needed
- Clear milestone tracking for 5.9 and 5.10 completion

### Risk 3: Middleware Conflicts (6.8 + 6.9)

**Impact:** Medium - Merge conflicts in `lib/middleware/`

**Mitigation:**
- Assign both 6.8 and 6.9 to Engineer 3
- Implement 6.8 (audit) first, then 6.9 (errors)
- Single feature branch for both stories

### Risk 4: Epic 5 Track A Takes Longer Than Expected

**Impact:** High - Delays overall timeline

**Mitigation:**
- Buffer built into Week 6-7 timeline
- Engineer 2 can assist with 5.4-5.6 after completing Track B in Week 4
- Parallelize 5.5 and 5.6 aggressively

### Risk 5: E2E Tests (6.2) Reveal Blocking Issues

**Impact:** High - Delays deployment

**Mitigation:**
- Start 6.2 in Week 4 (Engineers 3 & 4)
- Run E2E tests continuously in Weeks 5-6
- Fix issues immediately as Engineer 1 & 2 complete features
- Dedicate Week 7 to final testing and fixes

## Correction to workflow_execution.md

### Current Error in workflow_execution.md (Line 147)

**Current Text:**
```
├─ 6.13 (Admin panel)
  ↓
6.14 (Production deployment) — MUST BE LAST
```

**Implies:** 6.13 can run in parallel with other Epic 6 stories (6.1-6.12)

**Reality:** ❌ INCORRECT - 6.13 has dependencies on Epic 5

### Corrected Text

**Should Be:**
```
├─ 6.13 (Admin panel) — BLOCKED until Epic 5 stories 5.9 + 5.10 complete
  ↓
6.14 (Production deployment) — MUST BE LAST
```

**Dependency Chain:**
