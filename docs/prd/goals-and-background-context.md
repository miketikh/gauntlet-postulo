## Background Context

Demand letters are a critical component in the litigation process, representing the formal notification of claims and damages before potential legal action. Currently, attorneys spend considerable time reviewing source documents—medical records, police reports, correspondence, and evidence—to manually draft these letters. This time-consuming process delays litigation progress, reduces billable hours for higher-value work, and creates bottlenecks in case management workflows.

Steno's Demand Letter Generator leverages AI to transform this workflow. By allowing attorneys to upload source materials and generate draft demand letters using firm-specific templates, the tool automates the most tedious aspects of document creation. The addition of real-time collaborative editing (Google Docs-style) enables attorneys and paralegals to refine documents together, while AI-powered refinement capabilities allow for iterative improvements based on attorney feedback. This solution addresses a clear pain point in legal practice, positioning Steno as an innovator in AI-driven legal technology.
