# AI Refinement Guide

## Overview

AI Refinement is a powerful feature that allows you to improve specific sections of your demand letter using artificial intelligence. Rather than regenerating the entire document, you can select any portion of text and refine it with targeted AI assistance.

### When to Use AI Refinement

- **Strengthen Arguments**: Make language more assertive and compelling
- **Add Context**: Expand sections with additional details and background
- **Improve Clarity**: Simplify complex legal language for better readability
- **Adjust Tone**: Make content more or less aggressive as strategy requires
- **Emphasize Key Points**: Highlight liability, damages, or other critical facts
- **Condense Content**: Shorten wordy sections while preserving key information

## How to Select Text for Refinement

### Method 1: Click and Drag

1. Click at the start of the text you want to refine
2. Hold and drag to the end of the selection
3. Release to highlight the text
4. Right-click on the selection to open the context menu
5. Choose **Refine with AI**

### Method 2: Triple-Click (Select Paragraph)

1. Triple-click anywhere in a paragraph
2. The entire paragraph will be selected
3. Right-click and choose **Refine with AI**

### Method 3: Shift+Click (Select Range)

1. Click at the start point

- Defendant's responsibility should be clearer
- Case theory centers on liability issues

**What It Does:**
- Highlights defendant's duty and breach
- Strengthens causation arguments
- Emphasizes negligence or wrongdoing
- Cites relevant facts establishing fault

**Example:**
```
Before: "The driver did not stop at the red light."

```

#### 5. Soften Tone

**When to Use:**
- Preserving business relationships
- Early-stage negotiations
- Dealing with sympathetic defendants
- Strategy calls for diplomatic approach

**What It Does:**
- Uses more conciliatory language
- Reduces aggressive or confrontational phrasing

## Using Custom Instructions

For refinements beyond the Quick Actions, use Custom Instructions to give the AI specific guidance.

### How to Use Custom Instructions

1. Select the text you want to refine
2. Open the Refinement Panel (right-click > Refine with AI)
3. Click the **Custom Instructions** tab
4. Type your specific instructions in the text area
5. Click **Apply Refinement**

### Writing Effective Custom Instructions

**Be Specific:**
- Bad: "Make this better"
- Good: "Add specific dollar amounts from the medical bills in the source documents"

**Focus on One Change:**
- Bad: "Make this more assertive and add details and shorten it"
- Good: "Add more detail about the medical treatment timeline"

**Provide Context:**
- Bad: "Fix this"
- Good: "This section should emphasize that the defendant knew about the hazard but failed to warn visitors"

**Reference Source Material:**
- Good: "Incorporate the witness testimony from the police report about the defendant running the red light"

### Custom Instruction Examples

#### Example 1: Incorporate Specific Evidence
```
"Add quotes from the witness statement in Document 3 that describe the defendant's erratic driving before the collision."
```

#### Example 2: Legal Strategy
```
"Emphasize that this is a strict liability case and fault is not at issue, focusing instead on causation and damages."
```

#### Example 3: Client-Specific Details
```
"Include more information about how the injury has affected the client's daily life and ability to work, based on the intake notes."
```

#### Example 4: Structural Changes
```
"Break this long paragraph into three separate paragraphs: one for duty, one for breach, and one for causation."
```

#### Example 5: Tone Adjustment
```
"Rewrite this section to be suitable for a pre-litigation demand, maintaining firmness but avoiding inflammatory language."
```

- Check that you're in edit mode (not viewing only)
- Verify your account has AI refinement permissions
- Confirm the project is not locked

### Refinement Takes Too Long

**Problem**: Refinement is processing for over 60 seconds

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try selecting a smaller portion of text
- Refresh the page and try again
- Contact support if problem persists

### Refinement Produces Poor Results

**Problem**: Refined text doesn't meet expectations

**Solutions:**
- Try a different Quick Action
- Use Custom Instructions with more specific guidance
- Ensure source documents contain relevant information
- Select more context around the text to be refined
- Break large refinements into smaller, focused ones

### Changes Don't Match Instructions

**Problem**: AI didn't follow your custom instructions

**Solutions:**
- Make instructions more specific and clear
- Break complex instructions into multiple refinements
- Ensure instructions are achievable (e.g., can't add facts not in source docs)
- Try rephrasing your instructions

## Advanced Tips

### Combining Refinements

For complex improvements, chain multiple refinements:

1. **First Pass**: Add More Detail
2. **Second Pass**: Improve Clarity (after adding details)
3. **Third Pass**: Make More Assertive (to strengthen the expanded content)

### Creating Your Own Refinement Patterns

Develop custom instruction templates for your frequent needs:

**Medical Damages Template:**
```
"Structure this damages section into three paragraphs: (1) initial treatment and diagnosis, (2) ongoing treatment and therapy, (3) prognosis and future medical needs. Include specific dates, providers, and costs."
```

**Liability Analysis Template:**
```
"Reorganize this liability section using the following structure: duty, breach, causation, and foreseeability. Use topic sentences for each element."
```

### Using Refinement for Different Practice Areas

**Personal Injury:**
- Emphasize Liability + Add More Detail (medical treatment)

**Contract Disputes:**
- Improve Clarity (complex contract terms) + Make More Assertive (breach consequences)

**Property Damage:**
- Add More Detail (repair costs and estimates) + Emphasize Liability (defendant's negligence)

**Employment Cases:**
- Soften Tone (if preserving relationship) + Add More Detail (incident timeline)

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Personal Injury - Strengthening Damages

**Original:**
```
The plaintiff suffered injuries in the accident.
```

**Refinement**: Add More Detail

**Result:**
```
The plaintiff suffered severe and debilitating injuries in the accident, including a fractured tibia requiring surgical intervention with rod and screw fixation, torn rotator cuff necessitating arthroscopic repair, and traumatic brain injury resulting in ongoing cognitive deficits and memory problems.
```

### Example 2: Contract Dispute - Improving Clarity

**Original:**
```
Notwithstanding the parties' mutual covenant to perform services as enumerated in Section 3.2(a)-(f) of the Agreement, the defendant materially breached said covenant by failing to render performance in accordance with the specifications delineated therein.
```

**Refinement**: Improve Clarity

**Result:**
```
The defendant breached the contract by failing to provide the services required in Section 3.2(a)-(f) of the Agreement.
```

### Example 3: Property Damage - Emphasizing Liability

**Original:**
```
The water leak damaged the property.
```

**Refinement**: Emphasize Liability + Custom Instruction ("Include that the landlord was notified three times but failed to act")

**Result:**
```
Despite three written notifications from our client about the leaking pipe, the landlord negligently failed to make repairs, allowing the water leak to persist for six weeks and cause extensive damage to the property, including destroyed flooring, mold growth, and structural damage to the walls.
```
