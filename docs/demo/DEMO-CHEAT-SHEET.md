## 🎤 Key Talking Points (Memorize These)

**Act 1: The Problem**
> "Attorneys spend hours reviewing records just to draft demand letters. We reduce that to minutes."

**Act 2: Templates**
> "Create templates once, use forever. Static boilerplate, AI sections, and variables combine to ensure firm consistency."

**Act 3: AI Generation**
> "AI extracts text from PDFs and images using OCR, then analyzes all documents simultaneously. Watch it write each section."

**Act 4: Collaboration**
> "No more email ping-pong. See changes instantly—cursors, edits, comments. Full audit trail for compliance."

**Act 5: AI Refinement**
> "Quick actions for common edits, or write custom prompts. AI maintains context from your source documents."

**Act 6: Export**
> "Export to Word with preserved formatting. Ready for filing."

---

## 🚨 Emergency Backup Plan

**If AI generation fails:**
→ Have pre-generated project ready: "Rodriguez v. Smith BACKUP"
→ Say: "Let me show you a draft that was generated earlier..."

**If WebSocket fails:**
→ Skip live collaboration, show pre-recorded video clip
→ Or describe: "In production, you'd see live cursors and instant updates"

**If upload fails:**
→ Have project with docs already uploaded
→ Continue from variables step

## 🐛 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Don't skip showing templates (it's the stickiness factor)
- ❌ Don't rush collaboration demo (it's the differentiator)
- ❌ Don't forget to open the exported Word doc (lawyers need to see final output)
- ❌ Don't use technical jargon (Yjs, CRDT, WebSocket) unless asked
- ❌ Don't apologize for UI polish issues (just keep moving)
- ❌ Don't demo on spotty Wi-Fi (real-time features will lag)
